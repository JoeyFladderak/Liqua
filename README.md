Liqua is a project I made during the specialization phase of my education, where I specialized in special effects and graphics programming.

My aim with this project was to establish a framework with various underwater phenomena that together creates a realistic representation of an underwater scene. The direction I chose for the implementations was to create the most convincing effects as cheaply as possible so it remains very feasible for usage in games, while still trying to look as accurate as possible. With this in mind, the implementations are not physically accurate, but are represented closely enough to be convincing.

Everything is made from scratch, the framework is made with modern OpenGL in mind and tries to note make use of any deprecated functionality.
